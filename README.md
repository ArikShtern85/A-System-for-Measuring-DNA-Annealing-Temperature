# A-System-for-Measuring-DNA-Annealing-Temperature

Hello and welcome to my project!

Overview
The purpose of this project is to improve an existing system for measureing DNA annealing temperature. essentially, the measurment is done by warming and cooling a DNA sample and monitoring its fluorescence levels.

This project consists of two main parts:
1. Production - manufacturing PCBs to replace the Breadboards which carried the required electronic circuitry, in order to improve the systems reliability and noise immunity.
2. software - creating a Graphic User Interface using MATLAB instead the existing LABVIEW one. 

Features
We manufactured two PCBs - Timing circuit and Temperature Circuit. 
All the relevant Kicad files are organized in the repo.

Setup and Installation
In order to view the Kicad files:
1. download Kicad from https://kicad.org/download/
2. download the files from the repo.
3. open the .pro inside to view the PCBs scheme, layout etc.
