# A-System-for-Measuring-DNA-Annealing-Temperature

Hello and welcome to my project!

Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a system for measureing DNA annealing temperature. essentially, the measurment is done by warming and cooling a DNA sample and monitoring the changes in its fluorescence levels.

The project is based on an exsiting outdated and improves it by focusing on two main parts:
1. Production - manufacturing PCBs to replace the Breadboards which carried the required electronic circuitry, in order to improve the systems reliability and noise immunity.
2. software - creating a Graphic User Interface using MATLAB instead the existing LABVIEW one. 

Features
We manufactured two PCBs - Timing circuit and Temperature Circuit. 
the repo holds a folder for each circuit which we built and a powerpoint presentation in hebrew which explains the project:
1. Temperature circuit folder.
2. Timing (Lock In Detection) circuit folder.
3. Project presentation (in hebrew).

All the relevant Kicad files for each of the two circuits which we built are organized in the the relevant folder.

Setup and Installation
In order to view the Kicad files:
1. download Kicad from https://kicad.org/download/
2. download the files from the repo.
3. open the .pro inside to view the PCBs scheme, layout etc

Credits
This project was made together with my partner Leor Atzitz and under the guidance of Prof. Arye Weiss, faculty of engineering, Bar Ilan university.
